title: Bayesian Model Averaging of Chain Event Graphs for Robust Explanatory Modelling
abstract: Chain Event Graphs (CEGs) are a widely applicable class of probabilistic
  graphical model that can represent context-specific independence statements and
  asymmetric unfoldings of events in an easily interpretable way. Existing model selection
  literature on CEGs has largely focused on obtaining the maximum a posteriori (MAP)
  CEG. However, MAP selection is well-known to ignore model uncertainty. Here, we
  explore the use of Bayesian model averaging over this class. We demonstrate how
  this approach can quantify model uncertainty and leads to more robust inference
  by identifying shared features across multiple high-scoring models. Because the
  space of possible CEGs is huge, scoring models exhaustively for model averaging
  in all but small problems is prohibitive. However, we provide a simple modification
  of an existing model selection algorithm, that samples the model space, to illustrate
  the efficacy of Bayesian model averaging compared to more standard MAP modelling.
