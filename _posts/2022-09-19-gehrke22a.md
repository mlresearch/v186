title: Who did it? Identifying the Most Likely Origins of Events
abstract: One probabilistic inference task concerns answering queries for conditional
  marginal distributions, where a set of events is given. In this paper, we investigate
  the problem of only knowing that events are observed, from a number of sensors or
  for individuals, but not which sensors or individuals exhibit those events specifically.
  This situation might occur in multi-agent settings, such as in nanosystems, where
  single agents can no longer be tracked. However, to be able to perform probabilistic
  inference, those events need to be mapped to random variables, specifically to those
  that are most likely to exhibit those events. For the mapping, we show how lifting
  allows for generating all different possibilities to map those events, as we can
  do it over sets of indistinguishable random variables, leading to a set of queries.
  Given the mapping that leads to the most likely answer, we can construct evidence
  to perform probabilistic inference with. Finally, we compare solving the problem
  on the propositional level, which cannot be done in reasonable time, to our approach,
  which returns liftable evidence for tractable inference.
