title: Limited Memory Influence Diagrams for Attribute Statistical Process Control
  with Variable Sample Sizes
abstract: Limited Memory Influence Diagrams (LIMIDs) are implemented for statistical
  process control (SPC) to monitor the quality of the output from a production process
  where the number of defective units in a sample is measured at each time period.  The
  observed defectives provide the input to a decision on whether to stop the process
  and repair a problematic cause of variation.  The model also allows the decision
  maker to increase the size of the next sample in order to better discern whether
  or not the process actually requires investigation.  The model only requires the
  user to know the size and result of the current sample to make a decision, in contrast
  to Bayesian methods that require calculations based on all prior samples and a history
  of actions.  Despite the limited information, the model provides competitive quality
  costs to existing methods for a wide range of production time horizons.
