title: Knowledge transfer for learning subject-specific causal models
abstract: Subject-specific causal models are appropriate for domains such as biology,
  medicine, and neuroscience,  where the causal relations vary across the individuals
  of a population. However, its learning could be challenging, particularly under
  limited data sets. Although some works have addressed this issue, they are restricted
  to discovering up to   Markov equivalence classes.    In this work, we propose a
  method for the causal relations identification of subject-specific models. We hypothesized
  that transferring related data sets and locally performing interventions improves
  the causal direction identification of relations.   The experimental results on
  true and imperfect Markov equivalence classes of synthetic causal Bayesian networks
  show that our method performing interventions over several subsets of the candidate
  parents and using related data according to their differences with targets recovers
  a higher number of correct oriented edges.
