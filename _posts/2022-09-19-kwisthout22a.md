title: Speeding up approximate MAP by applying domain knowledge about relevant variables
abstract: The MAP problem in Bayesian networks is notoriously intractable, even when
  approximated. In an earlier paper we introduced the Most Frugal Explanation heuristic
  approach to solving MAP, by partitioning the set of intermediate variables (neither
  observed nor part of the MAP variables) into a set of relevant variables, which
  are marginalized out, and irrelevant variables, which will be assigned a sampled
  value from their domain. In this study we explore whether knowledge about which
  variables are relevant for a particular query (i.e., domain knowledge) speeds up
  computation sufficiently to beat both exact MAP as well as approximate MAP while
  giving reasonably accurate results. Our results are inconclusive, but also show
  that this probably depends on the specifics of the MAP query, most prominently the
  number of MAP variables.
