title: A Hybrid Algorithm for Learning Causal Networks using Uncertain Experts’ Knowledge
abstract: Bayesian networks (BN) have become one of the most popular frameworks in
  causal studies. The causal relations between variables are encoded by the structure
  of the model, which is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Unfortunately, despite the
  significant advances in algorithm development, learning the causal structure from
  data remains a very challenging task, especially for cases with a large number of
  variables. When the learning algorithm fails to identify the causal orientation
  of some edges, the human expert can provide some rough guidelines to complete the
  causal discovery. In many application domains, the expert knowledge might be uncertain
  about the right orientation of the edge. Worst, it may contradict the orientations
  learned from observational data, hence leading to conflicting situations. This paper
  presents a new hybrid algorithm combining a constraint-based approach with a greedy
  search, that includes specific rules to cope with uncertain domain/expert knowledge
  at different steps of the learning process. Experiments show the robustness of our
  method compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.
