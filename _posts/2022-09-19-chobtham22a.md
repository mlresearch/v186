title: Discovery and density estimation of latent confounders in Bayesian networks
  with evidence lower bound
abstract: 'Discovering and parameterising latent confounders represent important and
  challenging problems in causal structure learning and density estimation respectively.
  In this paper, we focus on both discovering and learning the distribution of latent
  confounders. This task requires solutions that come from different areas of statistics
  and machine learning. We combine elements of variational Bayesian methods, expectation-maximisation,
  hill-climbing search, and structure learning under the assumption of causal insufficiency.
  We propose two learning strategies; one that maximises model selection accuracy,
  and another that improves computational efficiency in exchange for minor reductions
  in accuracy. The former strategy is suitable for small networks and the latter for
  moderate size networks. Both learning strategies perform well relative to existing
  solutions. '
