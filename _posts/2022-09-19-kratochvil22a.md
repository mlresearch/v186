title: Learning Noisy-Or Networks with an Application in Linguistics
abstract: In this paper we discuss the issue of learning Bayesian networks whose conditional
  probability tables (CPTs) are either noisy-or models or general CPTs. We refer to
  these models as Mixed Noisy-Or Bayesian Networks. In order to learn the structure
  of such Bayesian networks we modify the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) used
  for general Bayesian networks so that it reflects the number of parameters of a
  noisy-or model. We prove the log-likelihood function of a noisy-or model has a unique
  maximum and adapt the EM-learning method for leaky noisy-or models. We evaluate
  the proposed approach on synthetic data where it performs substantially better than
  general BNs. We apply this approach also to a problem from the domain of linguistics.
  We use Mixed Noisy-Or Bayesian Networks to model spread of loanwords in the South-East
  Asia Archipelago. We perform numerical experiments in which we compare prediction
  ability of general Bayesian Networks with Mixed Noisy-Or Bayesian Networks.
