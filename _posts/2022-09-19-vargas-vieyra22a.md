title: Robust Estimation of Laplacian Constrained Gaussian Graphical Models with Trimmed
  Non-convex Regularization
abstract: The problem of discovering a structure that fits a collection of vector
  data is of crucial importance for a variety of applications. Such problems can be
  framed as Laplacian con- strained Gaussian Graphical Model inference. Existing algorithms
  rely on the assumption that all the available observations are drawn from the same
  Multivariate Gaussian dis- tribution. However, in practice it is common to find
  scenarios where the datasets are contaminated with a certain number of outliers.
  The purpose of this work is to address that problem. We propose a robust method
  based on Trimmed Least Squares that copes with the presence of corrupted samples.
  We provide statistical guarantees on the estimation error and present results on
  both simulated data and real-world data.
