title: Convergence of Feedback Arc Set-Based Heuristics for Linear Structural Equation
  Models
abstract: Score-based structure learning in Bayesian networks, where local structures
  in the graph are given a score and one seeks to recover a high-scoring DAG from
  data, is an NP-hard problem. While the general learning problem is combinatorial,
  the more restricted framework of linear structural equation models (SEMs) enables
  learning Bayesian networks using continuous optimization methods. Large scale structure
  learning has become an important problem in linear SEMs and many approximate methods
  have been developed to address it. Among them, feedback arc set-based methods learn
  the DAG by alternating between unconstrained gradient descent-based step to optimize
  an objective function and solving a maximum acyclic subgraph problem to enforce
  acyclicity. In the present work, we build upon previous contributions on such heuristics
  by first establishing mathematical convergence analysis, previously lacking; second,
  we show empirically how one can significantly speed-up convergence in practice using
  simple warmstarting strategies.
