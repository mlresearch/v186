title: 'Causal Discovery and Reinforcement Learning: A Synergistic Integration'
abstract: Both Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Causal Modeling (CM) are indispensable
  parts in the road for general artificial intelligence, however, they are usually
  treated separately, despite the fact that both areas can effectively complement
  each other in problem solving. On one hand, the interventional nature of the data
  generating process in RL favors the discovery of the underlying causal structure.
  On the other hand, if an agent knows the possible consequences of its actions, given
  by causal models, it can make better selections of them, reducing exploration and,
  therefore, accelerating the learning process. Also, ensuring that such an agent
  maintains a causal model for the world it operates in, improves interpretability
  and transfer learning, among other benefits. In this article, we propose a combination
  strategy to provide an intelligent agent with the ability to simultaneously learn
  and use causal models in the context of reinforcement learning. The proposed method
  learns a Causal Dynamic Bayesian Network for each of the agent actions and uses
  those models to improve the action selection process.  To test our algorithm, experiments
  were performed on a simple synthetic scenario called the “coffee-task". Our method
  achieves better results in policy learning than a traditional model-free algorithm
  (Q-Learning), and it also learns the underlying causal models. We believe that the
  results obtained reveal several interesting and challenging directions for future
  work.
