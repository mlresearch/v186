title: A Decision Support System to Predict Acute Fish  Toxicity
abstract: 'We present a decision support system using a Bayesian network to predict
  acute fish toxicity from multiple lines of evidence.  Fish embryo toxicity testing
  has been proposed as an alternative to using juvenile or adult fish in acute toxicity
  testing for hazard assessments of chemicals.  The European Chemicals Agency has
  recommended the development of a so-called weight-of-evidence approach for strengthening
  the evidence from fish embryo toxicity testing.  While weight-of-evidence approaches
  in the ecotoxicology and ecological risk assessment community in the past have been
  largely qualitative, we have developed a Bayesian network  for using fish embryo
  toxicity data in a quantitative approach. The   system enables users to efficiently
  predict the potential toxicity of a chemical substance based on multiple types of
  evidence  including physical and chemical properties, quantitative structure-activity
  relationships, toxicity to algae and daphnids, and fish gill cytotoxicity.   The   system
  is demonstrated on three chemical substances of different levels of toxicity.    It
  is  considered   as a promising step towards a probabilistic weight-of-evidence
  approach to predict acute fish toxicity from fish embryo toxicity. '
