title: Integrating Bayesian network classifiers to deal with the partial label ranking
  problem
abstract: The label ranking problem consists in learning preference models from training
  datasets labeled with a (possibly incomplete) ranking of the class labels, and the
  goal is to predict a ranking for a given unlabeled instance. In this work, we focus
  on the particular case where the training dataset and the prediction given as output
  allow tied class labels (i.e., there is no particular preference among them), known
  as the partial label ranking problem. This paper transforms the ranking with ties
  into discrete variables representing the preference relations (precedes, ties, and
  succeeds) among pairs of class labels. We then use Bayesian network classifiers
  to model the pairwise preferences. Finally, we input the posterior probabilities
  into the pair order matrix used to solve the corresponding rank aggregation problem
  at inference time. The experimental evaluation shows that our proposals are competitive
  in accuracy with the state-of-the-art mixture-based probabilistic graphical models
  while being much faster.
