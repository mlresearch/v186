title: Highly Efficient Structural Learning of Sparse Staged Trees
abstract: Several structural learning algorithms for staged tree models, an asymmetric
  extension of Bayesian networks, have been defined. However, they do not scale efficiently
  as the number of variables considered increases. Here we introduce the first scalable
  structural learning algorithm for staged trees, which searches over a space of models
  where only a small number of dependencies can be imposed. A simulation study as
  well as a real-world application illustrate our routines and the practical use of
  such data-learned staged trees.
