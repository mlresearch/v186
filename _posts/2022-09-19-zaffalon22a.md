title: Bounding Counterfactuals under Selection Bias
abstract: Causal analysis may be affected by selection bias, which is defined as the
  systematic exclusion of data from a certain subpopulation. Previous work in this
  area focused on the derivation of identifiability conditions. We propose instead
  a first algorithm to address both identifiable and unidentifiable queries. We prove
  that, in spite of the missingness induced by the selection bias, the likelihood
  of the available data is unimodal. This enables us to use the causal expectation-maximisation
  scheme to obtain the values of causal queries in the identifiable case, and to compute
  bounds otherwise. Experiments demonstrate the approach to be practically viable.
  Theoretical convergence characterisations are provided.
