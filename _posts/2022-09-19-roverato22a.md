title: Model inclusion lattice of coloured Gaussian graphical models for paired data
abstract: We consider the problem of learning a graphical model when the observations
  come from two groups sharing the same variables but, unlike the usual approach to
  the joint learning of graphical models, the two groups do not correspond to different
  populations and therefore produce dependent samples.  A Gaussian graphical model
  for paired data may be implemented by applying the methodology developed for the
  family of graphical models with edge and vertex symmetries, also known as coloured
  graphical models. We identify a family of coloured graphical models suited for the
  paired data problem and investigate the structure of the corresponding model space.
  More specifically, we provide a comprehensive description of the lattice structure
  formed by this family of models under the model inclusion order. Furthermore, we
  give rules for the computation of the join and meet operations between models, which
  are useful in the exploration of the model space. These are then applied to implement
  a stepwise model search procedure and an application to the identification of a
  brain network from fMRI data is given.
