title: The Functional LiNGAM
abstract: We consider a causal order such as the cause and effect among variables.
  In the Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM), we can only identify the order
  if at least one of the variables is non-Gaussian. This paper extends the notion
  of variables to functions (Functional Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model, Func-LiNGAM).
  We first prove that we can identify the order among random functions if and only
  if one of them is a non-Gaussian process. In the actual procedure, we approximate
  the functions by random vectors. To improve the correctness and efficiency, we propose
  to optimize the coordinates of the vectors in such a way as functional principal
  component analysis. The experiments contain an order identification simulation among
  multiple functions for given samples. In particular, we apply the Func-LiNGAM to
  recognize the brain connectivity pattern with fMRI data. We can see the improvements
  in accuracy and execution speed compared to existing methods.
