title: A Hardware Perspective to Evaluating Probabilistic Circuits
abstract: The always-increasing development of AI-enhanced Internet-of-Things devices
  has recently pushed the need for on-device computation of AI models. As these tasks
  require mak- ing robust predictions under uncertainty, probabilistic (graphical)
  models have recently gained interest also for these applications. However, embedded
  computation requires high computational efficiency (i.e., high speed and low power)
  through hardware acceleration. Although the acceleration of deep learning models
  has shown extensive benefits, this has not translated to probabilistic models as
  of yet. Probabilistic circuits (PCs), a family of tractable probabilistic models,
  allow a direct hardware view as they are represented in the form of a computational
  graph. Over the years, various approaches for structure learning of PCs have been
  proposed, however, without consideration of their potential hardware cost. In this
  work, we propose to take a hardware perspective in the evaluation of PC structures.
  We compare several structure learning strategies, associating each PC with hardware
  costs (computation power, speed, efficiency), and evaluate which one leads to more
  hardware- friendly implementations. Our results show that models imposing additional
  structural constraints on the PC are competitive models in terms of performance
  while being gen- erally more hardware-efficient, making them suitable candidates
  for energy-constrained applications.
