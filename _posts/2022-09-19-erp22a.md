title: Online Single-Microphone Source Separation using Non-Linear Autoregressive
  Models
abstract: In this paper a modular approach to single-microphone source separation
  is proposed. A probabilistic model for mixtures of observations is constructed,
  where the independent underlying source signals are described by non-linear autoregressive
  models. Source separation in this model is achieved by performing online probabilistic
  inference through an efficient message passing procedure. For retaining tractability
  with the non-linear autoregressive models, three different approximation methods
  are described. A set of experiments shows the effectiveness of the proposed source
  separation approach. The source separation performance of the different approximation
  methods is quantified through a set of verification experiments. Our approach is
  validated in a speech denoising task.
