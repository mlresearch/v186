title: Interpreting Time-Varying Dynamic Bayesian Networks for Earth Climate Modelling
abstract: Bayesian networks tend to be considered as transparent and interpretable,
  but for big and dense networks they become harder to understand. This is the case
  of non-stationary, and more generally time-varying dynamic Bayesian networks, as
  the relations change over time and cannot be represented with a single template
  model. We introduce methods to explain how the model evolves qualitatively over
  time, and quantify these changes. In addition, we offer a functional implementation
  for time-varying dynamic Bayesian networks that includes our explainability proposals
  and some extensions that are targeted to simplify the networks in the specific field
  of climate sciences.
