title: Parameterized Completeness Results for Bayesian Inference
abstract: We present completeness results for inference in Bayesian networks with
  respect to two different parameterizations, namely the number of variables and the
  topological vertex separation number. For this we introduce the parameterized complexity
  classes $\mathsf{W[1]PP}$ and $\mathsf{XLPP}$, which relate to $\mathsf{W[1]}$ and
  $\mathsf{XNLP}$ respectively as $\mathsf{PP}$ does to $\mathsf{NP}$. The second
  parameter is intended as a natural translation of the notion of pathwidth to the
  case of directed acyclic graphs, and as such it is a stronger parameter than the
  more commonly considered treewidth. Based on a recent conjecture, the completeness
  results for this parameter suggest that deterministic algorithms for inference require
  exponential space in terms of pathwidth and by extension treewidth. These results
  are intended to contribute towards a more precise understanding of the parameterized
  complexity of Bayesian inference and thus of its required computational resources
  in terms of both time and space.
