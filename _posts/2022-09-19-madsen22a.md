title: Online Updating of Conditional Linear Gaussian Bayesian Networks
abstract: 'This paper presents a method for online updating of conditional distributions
  in Bayesian network models with both discrete and continuous variables. The method
  extends known procedures for updating discrete conditional probability distributions
  with techniques to cope with conditional Gaussian density functions. The method
  has a solid foundation for known cases and may be generalised by a heuristic scheme
  for fractional updating when discrete parents are not known. A fading mechanism
  is described to prevent the system being too conservative as cases accumulate over
  long time periods. The effect of the online updating is illustrated by an application
  to predict the number of waiting patients at the emergency department at Aalborg
  University Hospital. '
