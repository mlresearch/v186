title: The Dual PC Algorithm for Structure Learning
abstract: Learning the graphical structure of Bayesian networks is key to describing
  data generating mechanisms in many complex applications and it poses considerable
  computational challenges. Observational data can only identify the equivalence class
  of the directed acyclic graph underlying a Bayesian network model, and a variety
  of methods exist to tackle the problem. Under certain assumptions, the popular PC
  algorithm can consistently recover the correct equivalence class by reverse-engineering
  the conditional independence (CI) relationships holding in the variable distribution.
  Here, we propose the dual PC algorithm, a novel scheme to carry out the CI tests
  within the PC algorithm by leveraging the inverse relationship between covariance
  and precision matrices. By exploiting block matrix inversions we can efficiently
  supplement partial correlation tests at each step with those of complementary (or
  dual) conditioning sets. The multiple CI tests of the dual PC algorithm proceed
  by first considering marginal and full-order CI relationships and progressively
  moving to central-order ones. Simulation studies show that the dual PC algorithm
  outperforms the classic PC algorithm both in terms of run time and in recovering
  the underlying network structure, even in the presence of deviations from Gaussianity.
