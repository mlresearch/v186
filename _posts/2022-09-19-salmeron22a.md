title: A Reparameterization of Mixtures of Truncated Basis Functions and its Applications
abstract: Mixtures of truncated basis functions (MoTBFs) are a popular tool within
  the context of hybrid Bayesian networks, mainly because they are compatible with
  efficient probabilistic inference schemes. However, their standard parameterization
  allows the presence of negative mixture weights as well as non-normalized mixture
  terms, which prevents them from benefiting from existing likelihood-based mixture
  estimation methods like the EM algorithm. Furthermore, the standard parameterization
  does not facilitate the definition of a Bayesian framework ideally allowing conjugate
  analysis. In this paper we show how MoTBFs can be reparameterized applying a strategy
  already used in the literature for Gaussian mixture models with negative terms.
  We exemplify how the new parameterization is compatible with the EM algorithm and
  conjugate analysis.
