title: A Transformational Characterization of Unconditionally Equivalent Bayesian
  Networks
abstract: We consider the problem of characterizing Bayesian networks up to unconditional
  equivalence, i.e., when directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have the same set of unconditional
  {$d$}-separation statements.  Each unconditional equivalence class (UEC) is uniquely
  represented with an undirected graph whose clique structure encodes the members
  of the class.  Via this structure, we provide a transformational characterization
  of unconditional equivalence; i.e., we show that two DAGs are in the same UEC if
  and only if one can be transformed into the other via a finite sequence of specified
  moves.  We also extend this characterization to the essential graphs representing
  the Markov equivalence classes (MECs) in the UEC.  UECs form a partition coarsening
  of the space of MECs and are easily estimable from marginal independence tests.  Thus,
  a characterization of unconditional equivalence has applications in methods that
  involve searching the space of MECs of Bayesian networks.
