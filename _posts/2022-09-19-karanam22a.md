title: 'Explaining Deep Tractable Probabilistic Models: The sum-product network case'
abstract: We consider the problem of explaining a class of tractable deep probabilistic
  models, the Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) and present an algorithm ExSPN to generate
  explanations. To this effect, we define the notion of a context-specific independence
  tree(CSI-tree) and present an iterative algorithm that converts an SPN to a CSI-tree.
  The resulting CSI-tree is both interpretable and explainable to the domain expert.
  We achieve this by extracting the conditional independencies encoded by the SPN
  and approximating the local context specified by the structure of the SPN. Our extensive
  empirical evaluations on synthetic, standard, and real-world clinical data sets
  demonstrate that the CSI-tree exhibits superior explainability.
