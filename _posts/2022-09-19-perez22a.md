title: On the rank of 2×2×2 probability tables
abstract: Bayesian networks for real-world problems typically satisfy the property
  of positive monotonicity (in the context of educational testing, it is commonly
  assumed that answering correctly a question A increases the probability of answering
  correctly another question B). In this paper, we focus on the study of relations
  between positive monotonic influences on three-variable patterns and a family of
  2×2×2 tensors. In this study, we use the Kruskal polynomial, well-known in the psychometrics
  community, which is equivalent to Cayley’s hyperdeterminant (homogeneous polynomial
  of degree 4 in the 8 entries of a 2×2×2 tensor). It is known that when the Kruskal
  polynomial is positive, the rank of the tensor is two. We show that when a probability
  table associated with three random variables obeys the positive monotonicity property,
  its corresponding 2×2×2 tensor has rank two. Moreover, it can be decomposed using
  only nonnegative tensors, which can each be given a statistical interpretation.  We
  study two concepts of monotonicity in sets of three random variables, strong monotonicity
  (any two variables have a positive influence on the third one), and weak monotonicity
  (just one pair of variables that have a positive influence on the third one), and
  we give an example to show they do not coincide. Furthermore, we proved that the
  strong monotonicity property implies that the tensor rank is at most two. We also
  performed experiments with real data to test the monotonicity properties. The real
  datasets were formed by information from the Czech high school final exam from the
  years 2016 to 2022. These datasets are representative since the sample size (number
  of students) for each year is very large ($N > 10000$) and information comes from
  students of all regions of the Czech Republic. In this datasets, we observed that
  almost all 2×2×2 tensors are monotone and all their corresponding 2×2×2 tensors
  have nonnegative decomposition.
