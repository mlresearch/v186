title: Approximate Inference for Stochastic Planning in Factored Spaces
abstract: 'Stochastic planning can be reduced to probabilistic inference in large
  discrete graphical models, but hardness of inference requires approximation schemes
  to be used. In this paper we argue that such applications can be disentangled along
  two dimensions. The first is the direction of information flow in the idealized
  exact optimization objective, i.e., forward vs backward inference. The second is
  the type of approximation used to compute this objective, e.g., Belief Propagation
  (BP) vs mean field variational inference (MFVI). This new categorization allows
  us to unify a large amount of isolated efforts in prior work explaining their connections
  and differences as well as potential improvements. An extensive experimental evaluation
  over large stochastic planning problems shows the advantage of forward BP over several
  algorithms based on MFVI. An analysis of practical limitations of MFVI motivates
  a novel algorithm, collapsed state variational inference (CSVI), which provides
  a tighter approximation and achieves comparable planning performance with forward
  BP. '
