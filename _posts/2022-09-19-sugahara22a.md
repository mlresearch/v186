title: Recursive autonomy identification-based learning of augmented naive Bayes classifiers
abstract: Earlier reports have described classification accuracies of exactly learned
  augmented naive Bayes (ANB) classifiers. Those results indicate that a class variable
  with no parent has higher accuracy than those of other Bayesian network classifiers.
  Additionally, asymptotic estimation of the class posterior identical to that of
  the exactly learned Bayesian network is guaranteed to be achieved. Nevertheless,
  exact learning of large ANB is difficult because it entails an associated NP-hard
  problem that worsens as the number of variables increases. Recent reports have described
  that constraint-based learning methods with Bayes factor achieve larger network
  structures than when using traditional methods. This study proposes an efficient
  learning algorithm of an ANB classifier using recursive autonomy identification
  (RAI) with Bayes factor. A unique benefit of the proposed method is that the proposed
  method is guaranteed to accelerate execution of the RAI algorithm when the data
  follow an ANB structure. Numerical experiments were conducted to demonstrate the
  effectiveness of the proposed method.
