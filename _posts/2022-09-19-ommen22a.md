title: Graphical Representations for Algebraic Constraints of Linear Structural Equations
  Models
abstract: The observational characteristics of a linear structural equation model
  can be effectively described by polynomial constraints on the observed covariance
  matrix. However, these polynomials can be exponentially large, making them impractical
  for many purposes. In this paper, we present a graphical notation for many of these
  polynomial constraints. The expressive power of this notation is investigated both
  theoretically and empirically.
