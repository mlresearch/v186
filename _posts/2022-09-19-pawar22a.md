title: Anytime Learning of Sum-Product and Sum-Product-Max Networks
abstract: Prominent algorithms for learning sum-product networks (SPN) and sum-product-max
  networks (SPMN) focus on learning models from data that deliver good modeling performance
  without regard to the size of the learned network. Consequently, the learned networks
  can get very large, which negatively impacts inference time. In this paper, we introduce
  anytime algorithms for learning SPNs and SPMNs. These algorithms generate intermediate
  but provably valid models whose performance progressively improves as more time
  and computational resources are allocated to the learning. They flexibly trade off
  good model performance with reduced learning time, offering the benefit that SPNs
  and SPMNs of small sizes (but with reduced likelihoods) can be learned quickly.
  We comprehensively evaluate the anytime algorithms on two testbeds and demonstrate
  that the network performance improves with time and reflects the expected performance
  profile of an anytime algorithm. We expect these anytime algorithms to become the
  default learning techniques for SPNs and SPMNs given their clear benefit over classical
  batch learning techniques.
