title: Using Mixed-Effects Models to Learn Bayesian Networks from Related Data Sets
abstract: 'We commonly assume that data are a homogeneous set of observations when
  learning the structure of Bayesian networks. However, they often comprise different
  data sets that are related but not homogeneous because they have been collected
  in different ways or from different populations. In a previous work, we proposed
  a closed-form Bayesian Hierarchical Dirichlet score for discrete data that pools
  information across related data sets to learn a single encompassing network structure,
  while taking into account the differences in their probabilistic structures. In
  this paper, we provide an analogous solution for learning a Bayesian network from
  continuous data using mixed-effects models to pool information across the related
  data sets. We study its structural, parametric, predictive and classification accuracy
  and we show that it outperforms both conditional Gaussian Bayesian networks (that
  do not perform any pooling) and classical Gaussian Bayesian networks (that disregard
  the heterogeneous nature of the data). The improvement is marked for low sample
  sizes and for unbalanced data sets. '
