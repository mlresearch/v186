title: Scalable Bayesian Network Structure Learning with Splines
abstract: The graph structure of a Bayesian network (BN) can be learned from data
  using the well-known score-and-search approach. Previous work has shown that incorporating
  structured representations of the conditional probability distributions (CPDs) into
  the score-and-search approach can improve the accuracy of the learned graph. In
  this paper, we present a novel approach capable of learning the graph of a BN and
  simultaneously modelling linear and non-linear local probabilistic relationships
  between variables. We achieve this by a combination of feature selection to reduce
  the search space for local relationships and extending the score-and-search approach
  to incorporate modelling the CPDs over variables as Multivariate Adaptive Regression
  Splines (MARS). MARS are polynomial regression models represented as piecewise spline
  functions. We show on a set of discrete and continuous benchmark instances that
  our proposed approach can improve the accuracy of the learned graph while scaling
  to instances with a large number of variables.
