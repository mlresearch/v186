title: Structure learning algorithms for multidimensional continuous-time Bayesian
  network classifiers
abstract: Learning the structure of continuous-time Bayesian networks directly from
  data has traditionally been performed using score-based structure learning algorithms.
  Only recently has a constraint-based method been proposed, proving to be more suitable
  under specific settings, as in modelling systems with variables having more than
  two states. As a result, studying diverse structure learning algorithms is essential
  to learn the most appropriate models according to data characteristics and task-related
  priorities, such as learning speed or accuracy. This article proposes several alternatives
  of such algorithms for learning multidimensional continuous-time Bayesian network
  classifiers, introducing for the first time constraint-based and hybrid algorithms
  for these models. Nevertheless, these contributions also apply to the simpler one-dimensional
  classification problem for which only score-based solutions exist in the literature.
  More specifically, the aforementioned constraint-based structure learning algorithm
  is first adapted to the supervised classification setting. Then, a novel algorithm
  of this kind, specifically tailored for the multidimensional classification problem,
  is presented to improve the learning times for the induction of multidimensional
  classifiers. Finally, a hybrid algorithm is introduced, attempting to combine the
  strengths of the score- and constraint-based approaches. Experiments with synthetic
  data are performed not only to validate the capabilities of the proposed algorithms
  but also to conduct a comparative study of the available structure learning algorithms.
