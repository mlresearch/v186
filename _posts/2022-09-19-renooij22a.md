title: Relevance for Robust Bayesian Network MAP-Explanations
abstract: In the context of explainable AI, the concept of MAP-independence was recently
  introduced as a means for conveying the (ir)relevance of intermediate nodes for  MAP
  computations in Bayesian networks.  In this paper, we further study the concept
  of MAP-independence, discuss methods for finding sets of relevant nodes, and suggest
  ways to use these in providing users with an explanation concerning the robustness
  of the MAP result.
